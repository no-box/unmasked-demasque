        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Michel's Present-Day Struggle</h3>
        <p>UNMASKED is a feature documentary about Michel,<br>a man whose face challenges the world's expectations - 
        and forces it to look inward. Living with a rare medical condition, Michel's story is not about deformity or pity. 
        It is about confronting society's obsession with perfection, and the discomfort we feel when faced with what we perceive as “different.”</p>

        <h3>What we see?</h3>
        <p>More than a character portrait, UNMASKED is a philosophical and emotional journey through perception, identity, and resilience.
        Featuring expert insights from neurologists, philosophers, and historians, the film connects Michel's experience to larger questions: 
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp <i>Why does the unfamiliar disturb us?
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp How do algorithms shape our instincts?
        <br> &nbsp &nbsp And what do we see when we truly look?</i></p>

        <h3>The Ghost of Joseph Merrick</h3>
        <p>A century ago, in the same city, Joseph Merrick - the so-called “Elephant Man” - was abandoned and exploited. 
        His story echoed through time, but what have we truly learned? 
        <br>UNMASKED is not about Merrick. It is about today. 
        And whether we've truly evolved in how we see - and treat - the unfamiliar.</p>

        <h2>Key Themes & Thematic Structure</h2>
        <p>The documentary is structured thematically, with each section exploring a different dimension of the central issue. 
        <br>The key themes include:</p>
        <h3>Face & Identity</h3>
        <p>How much of who we are lies in what others see? We explore the face as both a personal symbol and a social passport - a fragile interface between self and society. 
        What happens when that surface disrupts expectation?</p>

        <h3>Stigma & Prejudice</h3>
        <p>Why does difference trigger discomfort - or even rejection? Through Michel's lived experience and psychological insight, we uncover how visible difference often 
        becomes a canvas for society's unspoken fears and inherited biases.</p>

        <h3>Work & Inclusion</h3>
        <p>Can dignity survive in a system built on appearances? Michel's quest for employment reveals the unspoken barriers to inclusion - and the resilience required 
        to claim a place in a world that looks away.</p>

        <h3>MEDICAL & SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVES</h3>
        <p>Is visibility a diagnosis - or a social construction? With insights from reconstructive surgeons, neurologists and cancer biologists, we confront how science, ethics, 
        and the human gaze intersect in the treatment of “difference.”</p>

        <h3>History & Reflection</h3>
        <p>What has truly changed in a hundred years? From the forgotten footsteps of Joseph Merrick in 19th-century Brussels to Michel's present-day reality, 
        we trace the persistent echoes of spectacle, abandonment, and moral blindness.</p>

        <h3>THE MIRROR</h3>
        <p>Who do we see - when we look at someone else? The final thread is introspective: the story of Michel ultimately forces us to examine ourselves. 
        Our fears. Our thresholds. And the kind of humanity we choose to uphold.</p>

        <h3>ALGORITHMS & THE NEW GAZE</h3>
        <p>Are we choosing what we see - or being told what to look at?
        In a world shaped by curated feeds and predictive algorithms, the perception of beauty, normalcy, and worth is no longer just cultural - it's computational. 
        Michel's story challenges the digital mechanisms that filter difference out of view, raising urgent questions about who gets to be visible in the age of scrolling.</p>

        <h2>Why this film?</h2>
        <p><strong>A Story That Has Never Been More Relevant</strong></p>
        <p>Because some faces cannot be ignored - and shouldn't be UNMASKED confronts a deeply human discomfort: 
        the uneasy moment when we see a face that doesn't match the templates we've been conditioned to expect. 
        In that moment, a choice appears - to look away, or to truly see.
                            
        <h3>Disability & Employment</h3>
        <p>One in five Europeans has a disability, yet unemployment rates are 3x higher than average (Eurostat).
        This is not a story about medical rarity. It is a story about emotional proximity, social failure, and the possibility of change. Michel's life - unfiltered, 
        unsimplified - holds up a mirror to a society obsessed with perfection and terrified of authenticity. His struggle to be seen, hired, and heard reveals how deep the architecture of exclusion truly runs.</p>

        <h3>Brussels' Dark History</h3>
        <p>In an age of algorithmic beauty and curated empathy, UNMASKED dares to ask: What kind of humanity are we designing? And who gets left outside the frame?
        Merrick's abandonment in Belgium adds a haunting layer-how far have we really come?</p>

        <h3>A Universal Theme</h3>
        <p>"How do we treat those who look 'other'?"</p>
        <p>This film matters not because Michel is exceptional, but because what he reveals is. It is time to confront the fear behind the gaze - and the quiet violence of turning away.</p>

        <h2>Treatment & Story Approach</h2>
        <p>UNMASKED unfolds through a mosaic of observational moments, personal conversations, and thematic chapters that gradually build a complex, intimate portrait of Michel - not as a symbol, 
        but as a human being navigating the visible and invisible obstacles of everyday life.
        <br><br>We follow Michel not as a spectacle, but as a presence: going to work, interacting with friends, sharing coffee, walking the streets of Brussels. The camera stays close, but respectful - never voyeuristic. 
        His story is told in his voice, through his rhythm, allowing audiences to experience what it means to inhabit the world in a body that defies social expectations.
        The narrative is enriched by quiet, powerful dialogues with his family - particularly his mother - and those who share his everyday world. These moments provide not only personal 
        context but emotional counterpoint: glimpses of love, protection, and subtle tensions within the intimacy of shared experience.
        <br><br>While Michel's story is unique, it never stands alone. Interwoven throughout are reflections from philosophers, neurologists, and historians, offering deeper context - not to explain him, but to explore us. 
        The structure moves thematically rather than chronologically, with each chapter peeling back another layer of how society constructs - and reacts to - difference.
        <br><br>What emerges is not a linear biography, but a textured exploration of identity and perception - a film that listens as much as it observes. The pacing is patient, the tone restrained, 
        the visuals minimal and precise - allowing space for the audience to feel the discomfort, beauty, and humanity in equal measure.
        <br><br><i>This is not a film about what Michel lacks. It is about what we often fail to see - and what becomes possible when we finally do.</i></p>

        <h2>Director's Statement</h2>
        <p>The first time I saw Michel, it wasn't in a meeting room or through a casting call. It was on the street.
        My initial reaction surprised me - a mix of curiosity and discomfort, the instinct to look... followed by the impulse to look away. That tension stayed with me. Not because Michel demanded attention, but because something in me reacted. And I knew I wasn't alone.
        This film began with a question: Why do we respond the way we do to visible difference - and what does that reveal about us?
        After more than 30 years of filmmaking, I've learned to follow what unsettles me.
        <br><br>UNMASKED is a deeply personal project, not in the sense that it tells my story, but because it confronts a part of me - and a part of us - that we often leave unexamined.
        Michel is not a victim. He is a man with sharp wit, gentle presence, and a complex life that defies simplification. He is accepted by his community, shares jokes with friends, and dreams of a future not defined by diagnosis. In our conversations - including with his family - I found not tragedy, but dignity. Not spectacle, but substance.
        As a director, my task is not to explain Michel. It is to create a space where he can simply be - and where we, the audience, can begin to see not just him, but ourselves.
        This is a story I had to tell - because it began by quietly asking me who I really am, when I meet someone I don't understand.</p>

        <h2>Production conclusion and call for funding</h2>
        <p>UNMASKED is more than just a film about Michel - it is an invitation to reflect on our own responses to difference. It challenges us to confront the invisible barriers we build, not just around those who look different, but around our own understanding of identity, acceptance, and the human experience.
        In a world increasingly dominated by curated perfection, this film asks us to slow down and reconsider: What does it mean to truly see? Not just with our eyes, but with our minds and hearts.
        Through Michel's quiet resilience, we are reminded that the most profound stories are often the ones left untold. His journey is not about overcoming difference, but about living with it. And in doing so, he invites us all to explore the spaces where we hide, the identities we fear, and the faces we turn away from.
        UNMASKED is a call to be more present. More honest. More human.</p>
